# Setting up a GT.M Web Service

Suppose you want a new service named `spw`.  Do all of the following as the
superuser:
    
    mkdir /srv/spw
    chmod 775 /srv/spw
    chown http:http /srv/spw
    gpasswd -a swoods http

Now you want this service to be an MEnv environment:

    cd /srv/spw
    menv init
